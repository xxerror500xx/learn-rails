###Re-learning Rails
 Learning Rails with a new GitHub account via a tutorial from [the RailsApps project](https://tutorials.railsapps.org/)

 I am also going to start using some [formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-advanced-formatting/) in my README.md


```ruby
puts "Hello, Github!"
```

> “That’s it baby, when you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!”
>~ Zero Mostel, in movie [The Producers (1968)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063462/)

| some stuff   |  other stuff   |     more stuff|
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| things here  | Things there   | things rare?  |

- [x] checked the box for formatting
- [ ] finish the Tut. :thought_baloon: :feelsgood:
